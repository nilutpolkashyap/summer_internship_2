            <h3>What is Health Insurance?</h3>
            <p id="firstbody">Health insurance is an insurance policy that protects the policyholder and his/her family against the medical costs that arise due to an accident, illness or on the diagnosis of any serious disease. Today, several companies offer health insurance plans to their customers that provide various benefits such as cashless treatment at network hospitals, tax benefits, etc.</p>
            <h3>Why is Health Insurance important?</h3>
            <p id="firstbody">Today, quality healthcare treatment is expensive. A decent hospital has the potential to finish up your savings in a few days. Instead of worrying about the hospital bills, you need to concentrate your entire energy on the recovery. A health insurance policy can help you with that. You can approach any of the network hospitals which has a tie-up with your insurance provider and recover peacefully.</p>

            <h3>Things To Keep In Mind While Buying Health Insurance</h3>
            <p>
              To choose the best health insurance plan, there are a few factors that should be kept in mind before finalizing your decision. They are as follows:<br>
              <br><b>Provided</b>
              <br>Different insurers provide a variety of facilities and covers to the policyholder. It is vital to check all the facilities and the coverage provided so as to fulfill the requirements for treatment. Compare policies and make a checklist for your needs and choose the best plan accordingly.
              <br><b>Reliability of the Company</b>
              <br>The policyholder should go through the insurance company's website and its details before choosing a medical insurance plan. The profile and the history of the company should be checked along with the customer reviews to make the right choice.
              <br><b>Sum Assured Amount</b>
              <br>The principal point to be noticed while buying medical insurance is the amount of Sum Assured offered by the insurer to the insured. If you or your family members are suffering from any specific disease, you might have a fair idea of the amount to be chosen for future health costs. Hence, it is important to choose the sum assured wisely.
              <br><b>Co-pay & Deductible</b>
              <br>You should keep an eye out for the clause of co-pay & deductible which insurance companies attach with some of their plans. Just to be clear, It is a predefined amount (in %) which the insured agrees to pay for medical services. For example, if the co-pay is 10% and the claim amount is 2 Lakhs, 20,000 will be paid by the insured and the rest will be taken care of by the company.
              On the other hand, a deductible is the fixed amount which the policyholder has to pay each year before his/her plan begins to pay for covered expenses. For example, a person's deductible is Rs.1,00,000. In March, the person has a viral infection and the doctor's bill is Rs.10,000. Since this is the first payment of the year, the entire amount will be paid by the person (insured). In June, the person runs into an accident and has minor surgery. The total bill comes out to be Rs.1,50,000. Here the person will pay Rs.90,000 and the rest is paid by the company. In October, the person has 2 fractures and the bill is Rs.40,000. Since the person has paid the yearly deductible, the entire expense will be paid by the company. Learn More 
              <br><b>Add-On Benefits & Plans</b>
              <br>Companies offer numerous riders and additional benefits to the customer that actually boosts the coverage, scope and advantage of the policy resulting in a complete health cover protection shield. You may also add a top-up plan with the respective coverage by paying an extra premium.
              <br><b>Option For Cashless Claim</b>
              <br>Check whether the insurance company is providing the cashless claim facility as it is an important feature of the policy that will help in times of emergency hospitalization.

            <h3>How To Choose The Right Health Insurance Company?</h3>
            <p>

<br><b><u>Product Portfolio:</u></b> Don't forget that insurance is a vast industry and keeps on changing by time. It does not remain the same all the time and so does your needs.

<br><b><u>Smooth & Quick Claim Settlement Process:</u></b> It is advisable to search for an insurance company that follows a simple and easy claim settlement process. During emergencies, it is crucial to settle the claims on time so as to seek proper healthcare facilities.
<br><b><u>Customer Support Service:</u></b> Pay attention to the quality of customer services of an insurance company, for that you need to check for the ratings and reviews of the customers for the services provided. Choose the company that offers online chat, email assistance, and phone assistance.
<br><b><u>Insurance Advisor:</u></b> Insurance is tough to understand by a common person. But now many insurance companies appoint insurance advisors who will help you in choosing an appropriate insurance plan according to your needs.
<br><b><u>Feedback and Reviews:</u></b> One of the most important and common aspects are customer ratings and feedback received by an insurance company. You can go through the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) website to check the number of complaints and resolutions against the insurance company.
